Small project to keep up to speed with c++. The default version of Baccarat is Punto-Banco, but the version played in Casino Royale is called Chemin de fer. Punto-Banco is played according to fixed rules once
the player's bet is made, whereas Chemin de fer has some strategy and decision to it. Aces are low and face cards are worth 10. Hands are valuated by the units digit of their sum, so 10s and face cards are 
effectively worth 0. Therefore, the highest score in baccarat is 9. Punto Banco is played with 6-8 decks of cards, Chemin de fer is played with 6, for consistency both are played with 6 here.
I am trying to mimic real life Baccarat here, so the program still burns cards at the start.
